          <p>This is the plot in our pub #1. It shows the number of points coming from each source per country/state/date.</p>

          <p>This shows the details of the postprocessing: interpolation followed by easing spikes.
          For example, it shows clearly that most of our data is artificial for Kuwait as of 2020-05-12.
          For a list of countries with spike easing, check the data repo file "l2/interpolation_peakstats.csv".
          Example countries with special spike consideration: Austria (1 peak), Liechenstein (no peaks), Zimbabwe (should have no peaks), France (starting point could yield cases being larger than tests), China - Hubei (starting point of data is not 0).

        <a href="t11d-chisquared_dashboard.html" target="_blank">Chi-squared min/max thresholds for testing</a>
        <p>Calculates min/max number of cases for each corresponding number of tests under a p-value of 5%
           such that the 7-day moving sum is in-line with the 14-day moving sum.
           If the number of cases is below the minimum, then the country is doing well.
           If it is above it, then the country is not doing well.
