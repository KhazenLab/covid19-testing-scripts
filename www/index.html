          <p>This is the plot in our pub #1. It shows the number of points coming from each source per country/state/date.</p>

          <p>This shows the details of the postprocessing: interpolation followed by easing spikes.
          For example, it shows clearly that most of our data is artificial for Kuwait as of 2020-05-12.
          For a list of countries with spike easing, check the data repo file "l2/interpolation_peakstats.csv".
          Example countries with special spike consideration: Austria (1 peak), Liechenstein (no peaks), Zimbabwe (should have no peaks), France (starting point could yield cases being larger than tests), China - Hubei (starting point of data is not 0).

          <p>Calculates min/max number of cases for each corresponding number of tests under a p-value of 5%
             such that the 7-day moving sum is in-line with the 14-day moving sum.
             If the number of cases is below the minimum, then the country is doing well.
             If it is above it, then the country is not doing well.

            <p>Same as the detailed plot above, but kept only 2 plots of all,
               and added the slopes scatter plot by Halim showing the change in cases versus the change in testing for each country.

               The scatter plot is just the last entry for the detail page,
               but in this animation it shows the full history.
